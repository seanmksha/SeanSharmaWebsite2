 `I started with programming Java applications while interning at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab.  I later moved onto Video Game Programming by leading and participating in multiple team projects for school which included sending video game data to back-end websites. During this time, I began setting up front-end websites on the side as a hobby.  After acquiring my
 Bachelor\'s Degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, I focused more on web development and perfecting back-end technologies.  I received my Master's Degree from the University of Southern California, and I have been freelancing for clients since 2017 while constantly learning new technologies.  I also have been assisting and managing part-time in multiple large properties.
